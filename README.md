# Sound Recognition with FSD Kaggle 2018 Dataset

This thesis focuses on sound recognition within the FSD Kaggle 2018 dataset, which contains a variety of acoustic events such as musical instruments, human sounds, household noises, and animal sounds. The primary objective is to leverage machine learning, particularly deep learning, for accurate recognition and classification of these diverse audio signals.

## Key Highlights

### Tools and Libraries

The research utilizes a range of tools and libraries, including:

- **Python**: for scripting and data manipulation.
- **PyTorch**: for building and training deep learning models.
- **Librosa**: for audio preprocessing and analysis.

### Digital Signal Processing (DSP)

The study emphasizes essential DSP concepts, particularly:

- **Fourier Transform**: to convert audio signals into a suitable format for model input.
- **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)**: for effective feature extraction, enabling a time-frequency representation of audio signals. STFT addresses the limitation of fixed time and frequency resolution in standard Fourier Transform.

### Challenges and Solutions

The research highlights challenges in feeding raw audio data directly into neural networks, underscoring the importance of preprocessing techniques like STFT. These techniques allow efficient extraction of features that are critical for model performance.
